    <h2>Adoption</h2>
    <p>We got Nollie about six years ago now. My parents found her online and then my dad,
      who may be somewhat crazy, drove all the way to Montana to pick her up. In the middle of winter.
    </p>

    <h2>Type</h2>
    <p>Nollie is half golden retreiver and half border collie. She has all the fluff of a golden and the
      energy and brains of a  border collie. But ironically she hates water -- we tried a lot of different
      methods to get her to swim but none of them have worked so far.
