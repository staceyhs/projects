    <h2>Adoption</h2>
    <p>We got Nollie about six years ago now. My parents found her online and then my dad,
      who may be <strong>somewhat</strong> crazy, drove all the way to Montana to pick her up. In the middle of winter.
    </p>

    <h2>Type</h2>
    <p>Nollie is half golden retreiver and half border collie. She has all the fluff of a golden and the
      energy and brains of a  border collie. But ironically she hates water -- we tried a lot of different
      methods to get her to swim but none of them have worked so far. <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7c/a5/57/7ca5577e583201aca79b37ce7d3158f0.jpg">
      She looks a bit like this</a> but more golden.
