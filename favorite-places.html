    <h1>My Favorite Places</h1>
    <h2>A few favorites from places I have visited.</h2>

    <h3>Kyoto, Japan</h3>
    <p>There will be some more text here eventually, but essentially it's one of the most beautiful
      places on the planet. It's also so clean for a city of that size. Though I suppose Japan in
      general is outstanding for that category. <strong>I will try and find some photos later.</strong>

    <h3>Aix En Provence, France</h3>
    <p>If it wasn't for the smoking, I would probably say France in general was one of my favorites. 
      But unfortunately I just can't deal with the smoking in Paris.

    <h3>The Metropolitan Art Museum, NY</h3>
    <p>I love the Egyptian artifacts they have in there. But in general probably one of the best museums 
      that I've visited.

    <h3>Studio Ghibli Museum, Japan</h3>
    <p>As magical as you would imagine it to be. If you're ever interested in going, you'll probably have to have a Japanese friend or a tour group buy
       tickets for you. Buying tickets is ridiculously competitive during the normal tourist season. They sell out within <em>minutes</em> of going on sale -- and they only 
       go on sale once a month for the following month! If you're interested in learning more, you can check out <a href="http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/tickets/">here</a> 
       from their official site, though I would also recommend checking out a few blogs/how to guides as well. It's a complicated process sometimes.
